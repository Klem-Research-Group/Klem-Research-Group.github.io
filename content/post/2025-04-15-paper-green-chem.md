ðŸŽ‰ Exciting news! Our manuscript titled _Computer-Aided Design of Stability Enhanced Nicotinamide Cofactor Biomimetics for Cell-Free Biocatalysis_ has been accepted to *Green Chemistry*.

This work explores how structure-based design and quantum modeling can be used to identify robust, cost-effective NAD(P)H mimetics.

Thanks to our collaborators and the team for their hard work!
