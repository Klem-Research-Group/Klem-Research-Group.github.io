We are actively recruiting a **postdoctoral researcher** to join the Klem Lab at **Louisiana State University** starting **Fall 2025**!

The Klem Research Group at Louisiana State University invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher position in computational biochemistry, enzyme modeling, and biocatalyst design. We are a newly established research group in the Department of Biological Sciences focused on understanding and exploiting enzyme function using integrative modeling approaches. Our research bridges quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, machine learning, and biochemical design, with applications spanning **biocatalysis**, **sustainable chemistry**, and **drug resistance**. We are especially interested in candidates with experience in:
- Quantum mechanical or QM/MM simulations
- Molecular dynamics and/or enhanced sampling
- Python software development or workflow automation
- Enzyme catalysis or biocatalysis

Responsibilities:
- Develop and apply computational methods for enzyme catalysis, including QM/MM simulations and electrostatic modeling.
- Contribute to the development and extension of QMzyme, an open-source Python toolkit for high-throughput enzyme modeling.
- Design and simulate multi-enzyme complexes for plastic degradation and biocatalysis.
- Perform conformational sampling and structure-based mutational analysis using molecular dynamics and semiempirical QM methods.
- Collaborate with international and domestic experimental partners to validate computational predictions.
- Mentor graduate and undergraduate students in computational workflows and biochemical theory.
- Prepare manuscripts, present research at scientific conferences, and assist in developing grant proposals.

Minimum Qualifications:
- Ph.D. in chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, computational biology, or a related field by the start date.
- Strong background in molecular modeling, particularly in QM, QM/MM, or MD simulations of biomolecules.
- Proficiency in Python programming and scripting, and familiarity with scientific software development practices.
- Evidence of productivity through peer-reviewed publications and/or open-source contributions.
- Ability to work both independently and as part of a collaborative research team.

Preferred Qualifications:
- Experience with enzyme catalysis modeling or drug/enzyme design.
- Familiarity with software such as Gaussian, ORCA, AMBER, GROMACS, PyMol, or VMD.
- Interest in sustainability, biocatalysis, or antibiotic resistance mechanisms.
- Strong scientific communication skills.

Appointment Details:
- Initial appointment is for one year, with renewal contingent on performance and funding.
- Fully funded through startup resources, with a competitive salary and benefits.
- Start date is flexible, but we seek to hire early Fall 2025 to support lab launch and early research initiatives.


We value **collaborative, inclusive science**, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

If you're interested or would like to learn more, please **email Dr. Heidi Klem** at [heidiklem@lsu.edu](mailto:heidiklem@lsu.edu) with a CV and a brief cover letter outlining your research interests and how they align with the Klem Lab, and contact information for 2â€“3 references.
