### 🧠 Quantum Modeling of Enzymes  
We use quantum mechanical (QM) and QM/MM methods to study enzymatic reaction mechanisms with atomic detail, revealing how structure, dynamics, and environment influence catalysis.

### ⚙️ Computational Tool Development  
Our group develops open-source tools like **QMzyme**, designed to streamline QM workflows for enzyme modeling and make high-level computation more accessible to the broader community.

### 🔬 Enzyme Engineering and Design  
We apply computational insights to predict mutations, redesign active sites, and guide experimental efforts in collaboration with wet-lab teams.

### 🌱 Applications in Green Chemistry  
We aim to advance sustainable biocatalysis by designing robust enzyme mimics and understanding cofactor reactivity under industrial conditions.
