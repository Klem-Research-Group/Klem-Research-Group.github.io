### 🎓 Ph.D. Students

We recruit graduate students through the **LSU Biochemistry** and **Chemistry** Ph.D. programs. If you are interested in joining the lab, please email Dr. Klem with:

- A brief statement of your research interests
- Your CV or résumé
- Any relevant prior experience (e.g., coding, modeling, physical chemistry)

**No specific experience with quantum chemistry or simulations is required** — we’ll train you! Enthusiasm, curiosity, and a collaborative spirit matter most.
