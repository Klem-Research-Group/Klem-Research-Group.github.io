We combine theoretical chemistry, biophysics, and software development to investigate and engineer enzymes at the molecular level.

### ðŸ§  Quantum Modeling of Enzymes  
We use quantum mechanical (QM) and hybrid QM/MM methods to study enzyme catalysis. Our work uncovers the atomic-scale factors that control reaction rates and specificity.

### ðŸ§° QMzyme and Computational Tools  
We develop open-source tools like **QMzyme**, which streamline QM workflows for enzyme simulations and make these methods more accessible to the broader community.

### ðŸ”¬ Enzyme Design and Mutational Analysis  
Our simulations guide the redesign of enzymes with improved or altered functionality. We collaborate with experimentalists to validate our in silico predictions.

### ðŸŒ± Applications in Green Chemistry  
We aim to replace expensive or toxic catalysts with computationally optimized biocatalysts for sustainable chemical synthesis and biotechnology.
