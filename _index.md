Welcome to the Klem Research Group at Louisiana State University.  
We use integrative computational methods — including quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and data science — to understand and redesign enzyme function.

Our work bridges fundamental biophysics and practical applications in green chemistry, drug metabolism, and enzyme engineering.
