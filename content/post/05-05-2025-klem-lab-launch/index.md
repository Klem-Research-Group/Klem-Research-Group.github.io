The Klem Research Group will open its doors this Fall 2025 at Louisiana State University! ðŸŽ‰

Our lab focuses on integrative computational modeling of enzymes to address critical challenges in medicine and sustainability, including antibiotic resistance and plastic degradation. We're building tools like [QMzyme](https://qmzyme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make quantum enzymology more accessible, and weâ€™re excited to kick off collaborations, software development, and new research directions.

If you're interested in joining the team or learning more about our work, visit the [Join](/join) page or check out our [Research](/research) areas.

Stay tuned â€” we have exciting updates ahead!
